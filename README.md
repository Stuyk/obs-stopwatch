# ‚è±Ô∏è A Stop Watch for OBS

Simply counts up from zero once you enable the browser source. That's it.

Add a browser source then add the following URL: `https://stuyk.github.io/obs-stopwatch/`

**Note:** If you do not want the stopwatch to reset on scene switch then you need to create a new scene with just the stopwatch and overlay it on your other scenes. Hope it makes sense.
